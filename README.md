OpenWrt BOINC client feed
=========================

This repository supports the synchronisation of developments in support
of Volunteer Computing with BOINC on the OpenWrt platform: It brings
BOINC to small devices, i.e the edge of the internet.

No regular user is meant to work with this repository but whenever a
release is ready this shall move to the official community packages at
https://github.com/openwrt/packages.

The core package provided by this feed is "boinc". To support the maintainers
of BOINC projects we also experiment with packages of scientific applications
for BOINC, which can (but are not meant to be) installed by crunchers, too.

To contribute, you need the OpenWRT SDK and prepare a feed for this git
repository in analogy to the packages distributed for OpenWRT referenced
above.
